# Yati

Yati - The Ultimate Female Security App. We aim to create an application that can serve as the ultimate and all-inclusive solution for harassment and secual abuse across the world, simultaneously creating awareness in the society on a daily basis. The more the people realise how close to home such incidents ocur, the sooner our society can change and the world can become a better place for women.

# Meet the team - Binary Brains

The team behind "Yati" is Binary Brains, a trio comprising of 3rd Year, B.Tech CSE students, driven to make a change through our technical backgrounds. We were driven to solve this issue because, as an all-female team, we related to the problem on a personal level, and wished to change the experience of those around us.k
